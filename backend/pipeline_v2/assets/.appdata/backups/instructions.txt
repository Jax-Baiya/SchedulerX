This folder contains backups of all the .js files in ".appdata" (the parent folder of this).

Archive.html works completely offline, what it displays depends on those .js files.

Since those .js files are very important, historic backups are stored here. By using a backup, your Archive can be restored to a previous day. This is rarely needed, but just in case.

To use a backup:
1. move all the .js files in ".appdata" to another temporary place, in case you need them back.
2. open a backup folder, copy all .js files into ".appdata".
3. reload Archive.html

Note:
1. Auto backup happens when you use the browser extension ("myfaveTT"), no more often than once a day. Only the recent 10 backups are kept, older ones are deleted.
2. These .js files determine what MP4s Archive.html THINKS you have, but don't affect what MP4s you ACTUALLY have.
3. The browser extension also uses these .js files to know what have already been downloaded, so if you perform a restore, then run the extension, some mp4 files may be re-downloaded even though you already have them (but that's fine).
4. There's also a "fact.json" file, it's a simple export of all data for archival purpose. Each backup has a copy of it, but Archive.html doesn't need it.
